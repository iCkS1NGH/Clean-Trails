# 🌱 Clean-Trails: Pollution-Aware Eco-Route Planner
Clean Trails is a GIS-based travel route planner that helps users navigate cities using routes optimized for air quality. It promotes clean tourism by suggesting destinations with better environmental conditions using live and historic pollution data.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 🔵 Real-time pollution overlays using Google AirView+, OpenAQ & GDI
- 🧠 Pollution scoring model using heuristics and scikit-learn (optional)
- 🗺️ Interactive frontend map (React + Leaflet.js)
- 🧰 Django REST API backend
- 🧾 SQLite DB for user login and personalization
